Using IW
============
iw is a replacement tool for iwconfig.
ad-hoc is nothing Independant Basic Service Set(IBSS).

$ iw list | grep IBSS
* IBSS --> It Means your Wifi-Adapter has ad-hoc mode support.

The below setup tested on NEC's LifeTouch Tablet[Android V4.0.3]

NODE-1
------
ifconfig wlan0 down
iw wlan0 set type ibss OR iw dev wlan0 set type ibss
ifconfig wlan0 10.0.0.1 up
iw wlan0 ibss join arun-adhoc 2412 OR iw dev wlan0 ibss join arun-adhoc 2412

NODE-2
------
ifconfig wlan0 down
iw wlan0 set type ibss OR iw dev wlan0 set type ibss
ifconfig wlan0 10.0.0.2 up
iw wlan0 ibss join arun-adhoc 2412 OR iw dev wlan0 ibss join arun-adhoc 2412

3.6 GHz (802.11y) Band - Channels in IBSS Mode
===============================================
This range is documented as only being allowed as a licensed band in the United States


4.9 GHz (802.11y) Band - Channels in IBSS Mode
===============================================
The U. S. Federal Communications Commission allocated 50MHz of spectrum from 4940MHz to 4990MHz for public safety radio services in 2003.
50 MHz of spectrum from 4940 MHz to 4990 MHz (WLAN channels 20â€“26) are in use by public safety entities in the United States


5 GHz (802.11a/h/j/n) Band - Channels in IBSS Mode

1) DFS Channels are not supported in IBSS mode
2) Only 7 Channels[36, 38, 40, 42, 44, 46, 48] allowed in in IBSS mode at 5Ghz Band
3) Channels[38 42, 46] are Client only in IBSS mode.

Note:  Japan no longer allows 34, 38, 42, and 46 channels for connecting J52 supported old APs. Authorization to use these channels expired in May 2012.
